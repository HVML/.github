## Introduction

During the development of [HybridOS], [Vincent Wei] proposed a new-style
and easy-to-learn programming language called `HVML`.

The original design goal of HVML is to allow developers who are familiar with
C/C++, Python, or other programming languages to easily develop GUI applications
by using Web front-end technologies (such as HTML/SVG, DOM and CSS), instead of
using JavaScript programming language in a web browser or Node.js.

We have achieved this design goal and also designed HVML as a
general-purpose programming language. Now, we can not only use HVML as
a programming language to rapidly develop GUI applications based on Web
front-end technologies in the C/C++ runtime environment, but also use HVML
as a generic script language.

In addition to the specification documents that define a programming language,
the whole HVML project invovles many complex software such as the interpreter,
the debugger, the renderer, and so on.

Although we have basically achieved the initial goal, there is still a lot of
work to be done. It will be a long-term project, and it could not be achieved
with a few people or companies. The initiators of HVML, [Vincent Wei], decided
to unite others to jointly develop HVML in an open source collaboration.

Hence the HVML community is here.

From July 2022, we will gradually release the following source code repositories:

- PurC (the Prime hVml inteRpreter for C language).
- PurC Fetcher (the remote data fetcher for PurC).
- PurCMC (an HVML renderer in text-mode).
- xGUI Pro (an advanced HVML renderer based on WebKit).

Please stay tuned!
