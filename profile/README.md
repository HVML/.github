## Introduction

During the development of [HybridOS], [Vincent Wei] proposed a new-style,
general-purpose, and easy-to-learn programming language called `HVML`.

The original design goal of HVML is to allow developers who are familiar with
C/C++, Python, or other programming languages to easily develop GUI applications
by using Web front-end technologies (such as HTML/SVG, DOM and CSS), instead of
using JavaScript programming language in a web browser or Node.js.

We achieved this design goal and also designed HVML as a new-style and
general-purpose programming language. Now, we can not only use HVML as
a programming language to rapidly develop GUI applications based on Web
front-end technologies in the C/C++ runtime environment, but also use HVML
as a general script language.

In this article, we describe the design and the implementation of HVML.

From July 2022, we will gradually release the following source code repositories:

- PurC (the Prime hVml inteRpreter for C language): <https://github.com/HVML/purc>.
- PurC Fetcher (the remote data fetcher for PurC): <https://github.com/HVML/purc-fetcher>.
- PurCMC (an HVML renderer in text-mode): <https://github.com/HVML/purc-midnight-commander>.
- xGUI Pro (an advanced HVML renderer based on WebKit): <https://github.com/HVML/xgui-pro>.

## Members and Sponsors

The HVML project invovles many complex software such as the interpreter,
the debugger, the renderer, and so on.

This is a huge project, and it could not be achieved with a few people or companies.
The initiators of HVML, [Vincent Wei], decided to unite others to jointly develop
HVML in an open source collaboration.

The members make up the Administrative Leadership structure for the HVML Project.
They contribute time, money, and effort in order to consistently make the HVML
technically progressive and financially stable.
